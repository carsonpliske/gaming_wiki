          <Date>04/17/1989: Bush Offers Poland Assistance</Date>President Bush
          offers a program of special assistance for Poland, whose Communist
          government has agreed to negotiations with the opposition Solidarity
          party which produce a plan for free elections. Elections are held in
          August, 1989, which lead to the end of single-party rule in Poland.
          <Date>06/05/1989: Bush Condemns China’s Actions</Date>
          In the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacres, President Bush
          announces a number of condemnatory actions, including the suspension
          of the sale of American weapons to China.
          <Date>11/09/1989: Berlin Wall Falls</Date>
          The Berlin Wall falls, marking the symbolic end of Communist rule in
          Eastern Europe. On November 9, 1989, East Germany fully opened its
          borders, including the imposing gate at the Berlin Wall. Thousands of
          Germans, from both East and West Germany, climbed over the wall and
          began to dismantle it with shovels and hammers. The jubilant scene
          illustrated the great changes taking place with the ending of the Cold
          War. Since 1961, the Berlin Wall had stood as a symbolic barrier
          between the East and West, between communism and democracy: its fall
          reflected changing international relations. This episode, although
          memorable, was not the first or last in the relatively swift collapse
          of communism. Earlier in 1989, Hungary and Austria had opened their
          border. By spring of 1990, liberal political actors had wrested the
          governments of Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania,
          and Romania from the hands of communist leaders. The Soviet Union
          itself, for decades the most powerful adversary of the United States,
          had been undergoing fundamental political changes throughout the
          1980s, shaking its communist foundations. Soviet Premier Mikhail
          Gorbachev had worked to change the Soviet Union through the doctrines
          of perestoika (restructuring) and glasnost (opening). He had also
          worked with Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush to thaw the
          Cold War. By December 1991, the Soviet Union had dissolved and
          Gorbachev had resigned; the Commonwealth of Independent States had
          replaced the Soviet Union. Many conservative commentators have praised
          Reagan and Bush for substantially contributing to the fall of
          communism. These observers say that the tremendous military build-up
          of the 1980s forced the Soviet Union to spend scanty resources to keep
          up, which ultimately produced the instability that spelled its end.
          Others claim that internal developments in the Soviet Union-such as
          its unsuccessful war with Afghanistan and autonomous rebellions from
          within-are more to blame: high U.S. spending, they claim, only sapped
          resources from important domestic programs and meaningful diplomatic
          conversation. It is unlikely that this debate will soon be resolved,
          but the basic triumph of democracy seems inarguable. President George
          H. W. Bush embraced the geopolitical upheaval cautiously, and he was
          criticized for failing to give the moment adequate meaning and
          communicating its import to the American public. However, the
          President responded cautiously to try to avoid a backlash by
          hard-liners in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, a stance that
          well-informed observers applauded. The dismantling of the Berlin Wall
          was a poignant illustration of the collapse of communism and the end
          of the Cold War. The world was then faced with restructuring the
          geopolitical balance that had been in place for more than forty years.

          Panama to capture Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's military
          dictator. Noriega, who had been indicted in the United States on drug
          trafficking charges, surrendered on January 3, 1990. He was convicted
          on drug charges on April 9, 1992, and sent to prison.
          <Date>06/01/1990: Arms Reduction Agreement</Date>At a summit meeting
          in Washington, D.C., President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
          Gorbachev sign the broadest arms reduction agreement in two decades.
          The agreement stipulates that the United States and the Soviet Union
          scrap 25 percent and 40 percent of their respective nuclear
          stockpiles.
          <Date>08/02/1990: Iraq Invades Kuwait</Date>Iraq invades Kuwait.
          President Bush strongly condemns Iraq's actions, setting the stage for
          an American response.
          <Date>01/17/1991: Persian Gulf War Begins</Date>The Persian Gulf War,
          code-named Operation Desert Storm, begins with a massive, American-led
          air attack on Iraq. Early on the morning of January 17, 1991,
          coalition forces led by the United States launched air strikes against
          Iraq. These strikes signaled the beginning of the military phase of
          the Persian Gulf War. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, a
          neighboring country. Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, had long argued
          with Kuwait over the rights to certain oil-rich lands. He had been
          preparing to invade Kuwait for several weeks, but when the attack
          came-on August 2, 1990-it nevertheless surprised much of the world.
          Several countries in the Middle East had assured the United States
          that Hussein was massing his troops only to bluff Kuwait into meeting
          his demands. When the Iraqi leader sent 140,000 troops storming
          toward-and quickly taking-the Kuwaiti capital, President George H.W.
          Bush responded. The United States quickly intervened for a number of
          reasons. By invading Kuwait, Saddam Hussein gained control over a vast
          amount of the world's oil supply, which gave him the potential to
          wreak havoc with U.S. energy policy and oil prices. Bush also drew
          vivid parallels between Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler in the 1930s:
          a decisive, early blow to Saddam's imperialist ambitions, the
          President believed, would forestall another “Munich,” preventing the
          outbreak of a more serious crisis later on. Finally, political and
          military theorists thought that a show of U.S. military resolve would
          improve America's international credibility-especially in this first
          major crisis of the post-Cold War era-and boost confidence in a
          military still trying to throw off the legacy of the Vietnam War.
          President Bush and his administrative team were extraordinarily
          active, and extraordinarily successful, in building an international
          coalition to counter the Iraqi aggression. Perhaps the most impressive
          feat of international diplomacy was President Bush's ability either to
          neutralize or win outright the support of traditionally hostile China
          and Russia, together with many countries of the Middle East. He also
          persuaded Israel to stay out of the coalition, which made it possible
          for Middle Eastern countries to join without seeming to unite with
          Israel. The United Nations first approved the use of sanctions and a
          U.S.-led defensive posture, designed to deter Saddam Hussein from
          advancing any further and to persuade him to pull back from Kuwait. In
          November, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 678 authorizing
          member states to use “all necessary means” to remove Iraq from Kuwait
          if Iraq had not withdraw all of its forces by January 15, 1991. The
          U.S. plan to forcibly remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait was dubbed
          Operation Desert Storm and included an effective mixture of air power
          and overwhelming ground forces, including the use of 500,000 U.S.
          troops. Once the deadline passed and Iraq had not withdrawn from
          Kuwait, the U.S.-led coalition quickly overpowered the Iraqi military,
          and on February 28th, the coalition declared a cease-fire. When the
          war ended, President Bush had very high approval ratings for his
          conduct of the war and his success in coalition building. However, he
          endured criticism for failing to remove Saddam Hussein from power and
          destroy the Iraqi military. That stance left Kurds and Shiites who
          were sympathetic to the United States at the mercy of a vengeful Iraqi
          government, but President Bush apparently feared the consequences of
          Saddam Hussein's unknown replacement-and a geopolitically destabilized
          region-even more than Saddam himself.
