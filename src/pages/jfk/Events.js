          <Date>Bay of Pigs Invasion Begins</Date>On April 17, 1961, a brigade
          of about 1,500 Cuban exiles landed at Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs)
          on the southern coast of Cuba. Their mission was to overthrow the
          government of Fidel Castro by inciting revolt among the Cuban people.
          Funded and supplied by the United States, this invasion ended in
          absolute failure with some of the exiles killed and many captured by
          Castro's army. Although President John F. Kennedy wanted American
          involvement in the operation to remain covert, signs of CIA
          sponsorship of the brigade were obvious. In addition, the President's
          decision not to provide American air support for the invasion made him
          appear weak. The disastrous invasion stands out as one of the major
          mistakes of Kennedy's presidency. The plan for a covert invasion of
          Cuba originated in the administration of President Dwight D.
          Eisenhower. Supported by both President Eisenhower and Vice President
          Richard Nixon, CIA Director Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell, CIA
          deputy for planning, had trained anti-Castro forces in Guatemala in
          preparation for an invasion. Dulles and Bissell briefed Kennedy on the
          operation shortly after his election victory in November. Kennedy
          chose to reappoint Dulles to head the CIA in his administration. Some
          in the administration warned Kennedy not to follow through with this
          attack. Liberals in the administration such as Chester Bowles, Arthur
          Schlesinger, Jr., and John Kenneth Galbraith felt that a Democratic
          administration should not carry out this kind of “adventurism.” In
          addition, some foreign policy experts, such as Dean Acheson, feared
          that the operation as planned was too small and would not succeed.
          Still, most of the President's advisers maintained that this operation
          would work and rid the United States of a Communist dictatorship 90
          miles of the coast of Florida. President Kennedy wanted to blur any
          connections between the American military and the Cuban operation. The
          American press threatened the secrecy of the mission, however, when
          they reported on the training of exiles and an impending invasion.
          Kennedy chose not to authorize any air strikes by American planes
          during the mission, fearing that a downed plane would expose the
          American role in the plan. The operation was limited to one round of
          air strikes in disguised planes followed by the CIA-trained exiles
          landing at the Bay of Pigs to invade Cuba. On April 15, B-26 bombers
          from Nicaragua began the attack on Cuba. While they succeeded in
          destroying some of Castro's air force, their attack warned the Cuban
          leader of further assaults. When the invasion began on April 17,
          Castro quickly ordered his military forces to the area, trapping the
          exiles on the beach. By the next day, it was clear that the operation
          had failed. The planners had claimed that the invasion would spark an
          uprising in Cuba. However, the uprising failed to materialize.
          Kennedy, hoping to maintain American invisibility, refused to allow
          additional air strikes to salvage the disaster. In the end, some 115
          men died, and the Cuban forces captured almost 1,200 exiles. Criticism
          of the administration soon poured in from all political perspectives;
          President Kennedy had failed in the first major test of his
          administration.
          <Date>Kennedy Pledges to Support Space Program</Date>
          On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy in an address to Congress
          challenged the nation to “commit itself to achieving the goal, before
          this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon.” He asked Congress
          to find additional funds to support the nation's space program.
          President Kennedy was committed to an aggressive space program. The
          Soviet Union had surpassed the United States in the space race by
          launching Sputnik, an artificial satellite, in 1957. Since space
          technology demonstrated potential weapons, this competition became an
          important aspect of the Cold War. Although Kennedy realized the
          importance of space exploration to the military, he remained firmly
          committed to a civilian-controlled program of manned space flights.
          With the encouragement of Vice President Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy
          appealed to Congress to increase spending on the space program in the
          hopes of surpassing the Soviets. Then, on February 20, 1962, Astronaut
          John Glenn aboard the Mercury craft Friendship 7 became the first
          American to orbit the earth. Both the Kennedy administration and the
          American people celebrated Glenn's space flight. But Kennedy did not
          live to see his dream come true when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon
          in July 1969.
          <Date>Berlin Wall Started</Date>On August 13, 1961, East Germany began
          constructing a wall between the two sections of Berlin. The city,
          surrounded by Soviet-supported East Germany, had remained divided
          between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France since
          the end of World War II. Refugees from East Germany and the eastern
          section of Berlin had been flooding into the western section of
          Berlin, creating an embarrassment for the Soviet and East German
          governments. In June 1961, President John Kennedy met with Soviet
          premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, Austria, but the conference
          failed to resolve the long-standing conflict over the status of
          Berlin. Khrushchev wanted the United States, Britain, and France to
          leave the western section of Berlin to Soviet-controlled East Germany
          since the city lay deep in the heart of East Germany. He threatened
          that he would disregard the Western Allies and make an unilateral
          treaty with East Germany if the status of Berlin was not resolved. On
          July 25, Kennedy addressed the American people explaining the Soviet
          threat to West Berlin and the commitment of the United States to
          protect the city. The President appealed to Americans to make
          sacrifices to win this conflict and announced further increases in
          military spending. Despite these bellicose actions, Kennedy left open
          the possibility of negotiation, and he made no claims to the eastern
          sections of Berlin. The Berlin Wall ended the movement of East German
          citizens into West Berlin. In an impromptu protest, thousands of
          Berliners gathered on both sides of the new barricade. Kennedy was
          under pressure to act, but privately expressed an unwillingness to go
          to war over East Germany's right to close its own boarders. He quickly
          sent General Lucius Clay and Vice President Lyndon Johnson as his
          personal ambassadors to Berlin to demonstrate the strength of
          Washington's commitment. Finally, Kennedy sent a force of 1,500 troops
          across East Germany into West Berlin. While largely symbolic, these
          actions demonstrated to the Soviets that the United States was
          committed to supporting West Berlin. With this demonstration of
          American solidarity with West Berlin, Khrushchev ended his threats of
          a separate East German treaty. The construction of the wall provided
          the Cold War with a tangible incarnation of the Iron Curtain and
          marked the beginning of a de facto agreement between the superpowers.
          Both the United States and the Soviet Union allowed the city to remain
          divided and limited their action to protecting their sphere of Berlin.
          The resolution of the Berlin crises represented the end of an
          important point of conflict in the Cold War.
          <Date>02/03/1962: End trade with Cuba</Date>
          Kennedy halts virtually all trade with Cuba.
          <Date>10/28/1962: Cuban Missile Crisis resolved</Date>After thirteen
          days, the Cuban Missile Crisis is resolved. The United States will
          pledge not to invade Cub (and secretly agrees to remove missiles from
          Turkey), in exchange for the removal of the Soviet weapons.
          <Date>11/22/1963: Kennedy shot in Dallas</Date>Kennedy is assassinated
          while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald is
          arrested and accused of the crime. Vice President Lyndon Baines
          Johnson is sworn in as the thirty-sixth President of the United States
          following the assassination.
