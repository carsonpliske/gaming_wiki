          <Date>02/26/1993: Explosion at the World Trade Center</Date>Six people
          are killed and more than a thousand suffer injuries after a bomb
          planted under the World Trade Center in New York City explodes. The
          bomb marks the beginning of a string of threats against the United
          States made during the Clinton administration by both foreign and
          domestic terrorists.
          <Date>06/26/1993: Navy attacks Baghdad</Date>
          The U.S. Navy, under President Clinton's orders, attacks Iraqi
          intelligence operations in downtown Baghdad after learning that Iraqis
          had plotted to kill former President Bush during his April 1993 visit
          to Kuwait. The twenty-three tomahawk missiles fired reportedly kill
          eight people.
          <Date>10/04/1993: American forces ambushed in Somalia</Date>
          An elite American special forces unit searching for Somali warlord
          Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu is
          ambushed by Aidid's forces, leaving eighteen Americans dead. Three
          days later, President Clinton announces that all American military
          personnel in Somalia will be home by March 31, 1994.
          <Date>10/03/1993: Battle of Mogadishu</Date>
          On October 3, 1993, U.S. special forces stormed a compound in
          Mogadishu, Somalia, in order to capture aides to warlord Mohammed
          Farah Aidid. Commanders intended the attack to be swift and precise,
          but the operation quickly fell apart. Hostile Somalis shot down two
          hovering U.S. combat helicopters. U.S. ground forces were assaulted as
          they tried to flee and were ambushed as they attempted to reach the
          crews of the downed helicopters. With exits to the city blocked, and
          an increasing number of killed and wounded, American soldiers were
          forced to hunker down and await reinforcements. In the end, eighteen
          U.S. troops died, and eighty-four were wounded. America was left with
          horrific images of soldiers' bodies being dragged through the streets
          and angry questions of how and why such a disaster occurred. The U.S.
          presence in Somalia dated from December 1992. Then-President George
          H.W. Bush envisioned that “Operation Restore Hope” would be limited to
          humanitarian assistance and would ideally conclude sometime in early
          1993, time enough to have put Somalia on the road to recovery from
          famine and civil war. Nevertheless, the operation became more complex
          than anyone imagined. Leaders at the United Nations became convinced
          that Aidid, who had resisted political reform both prior to and
          following the recent introduction of UN personnel, was largely
          responsible for the harassment and killing of peacekeeping forces and
          humanitarian workers. In the end, they sought to remove him from
          power. When President Bill Clinton came into office, his
          administrative team sought to scale back the venture in Somalia. Calls
          from Congress and Pentagon officials, urging the President not to
          expand “Operation Restore Hope,” contributed further to a more
          circumscribed approach. Defense Secretary Les Aspin rejected requests
          from local commanders for more troops and vehicles, confident that
          U.S. forces would not attempt operations exceeding existing
          capabilities. The Battle of Mogadishu, however, led President Clinton
          not just to minimize but to end the U.S. presence in Somalia.
          Clinton's actions generated criticism from those who believed he
          should have carried through and captured Aidid- that in not doing so,
          he had simultaneously dishonored the soldiers' deaths and harmed
          American military credibility. The affair contributed to the
          perception that the President lacked foreign affairs expertise. Many
          became skeptical of the idea that the United States could or should
          serve as a post-Cold War, peacekeeping nation-builder, particularly
          under the direction of the United Nations. Regardless, the Battle of
          Mogadishu- both its causes and its effects -highlighted the
          complexities of the post-Cold War American military mission.
          <Date>Clinton Signs NAFTA</Date>On December 8, 1993, President Bill
          Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
          eliminated nearly every trade barrier between the United States,
          Canada, and Mexico, creating the world's largest free trade zone. The
          House of Representatives approved NAFTA on November 17, 1993, by a
          vote of 234 to 200. Remarkably the agreement's supporters included 132
          Republicans and only 102 Democrats. That unusual combination reflected
          the challenges President Clinton faced in convincing Congress that the
          controversial piece of legislation would truly benefit all Americans.
          President George H.W. Bush was NAFTA's original sponsor, signing the
          deal on December 17, 1992. The trade agreement ended tariffs between
          Mexico, Canada, and the United States, and set a 15-year timetable for
          the elimination of most other impediments to international investment
          and commerce between the three nations. Like many Republicans,
          President Bush believed that open economic borders between nations
          would benefit all concerned. Ideally, as production rose to meet the
          new demand for American exports, jobs, wages, and the economy as a
          whole would improve. However, securing Congressional approval fell to
          the newly elected President Bill Clinton. It was not an easy task.
          Labor leaders were skeptical of NAFTA's promises. They believed that
          American corporations would flee the United States in order to profit
          from much lower Mexican labor costs and the new absence of tariffs.
          Presidential candidate Ross Perot spoke to those concerns when he
          famously predicted a giant “sucking sound” as U.S. jobs were lost to
          America's southern neighbor. The fears of labor—traditionally one of
          the strongest components of the Democratic coalition—helped explain
          why passage of NAFTA proved so difficult. President Clinton and key
          members of his administration worked tirelessly to assuage the fears
          of key House Democrats. The President inserted limits on agricultural
          imports to minimize the negative effects of competition on produce. He
          also created a North American Development Bank in order to assist
          development along the Mexican border and show sympathy with the
          concerns of Hispanic Representatives. Clinton was willing to risk
          alienating American labor to some degree because he was convinced that
          long-term prosperity depended on free trade between nations, and
          because he felt that his administration needed an important, visible
          early win to generate momentum and credibility. NAFTA amounted to an
          administration victory, but many still regarded it as a net loss for
          American labor and the environment, which they claimed suffered in the
          absence of adequate Mexican regulations.
          <Date>01/31/1995: Emergency loans to Mexico</Date>President Clinton
          authorizes the U.S. Treasury Department to make an emergency loan of
          up to $20 billion to Mexico to forestall a financial crisis
          threatening the interconnected Mexican and American economies.
          <Date>04/19/1995: Oklahoma City bombed</Date>In an act of domestic
          terrorism, a bomb planted in a truck parked in front of the Alfred P.
          Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, kills 168 people
          and causes massive structural damage. In the days following the
          tragedy, Clinton, in widely-praised efforts, speaks with victims and
          to the country about how to recover physically, emotionally, and
          spiritually from the attack.
          <Date>08/30/1995: NATO begins strikes on Serbia</Date>NATO, with a
          strong contingent of American forces, begins two weeks of air attacks
          on Serbian positions.
          <Date>10/23/1995: Improving U.S.-Russia relations</Date>President
          Clinton and Russian president Yeltsin meet in Hyde Park, New York, and
          continue to discuss ways to improve relations between their two
          nations, especially with regard to the issue of nuclear arms.
          <Date>11/29/1995: Clinton urges peace in Ireland</Date>During a tour
          of Europe, President Clinton urges the continuation of peace efforts
          in Northern Ireland where longstanding conflict between Irish
          Protestants and Catholics escalated to violence over issues of
          economic and political autonomy.
          <Date>09/03/1996: Missile strikes Iraq</Date>President Clinton orders
          a cruise missile strike against Iraq after Saddam Hussein leads a
          siege against the Kurdish city of Irbil in northern Iraq.
          <Date>09/24/1996: UN bans nuclear weapons testing</Date>An
          overwhelming majority of United Nations members, including the United
          States, agree to a treaty banning all nuclear weapons testing.
          <Date>04/24/1997: Chemical Weapons become illegal</Date>The Senate
          ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention, making illegal the
          production, acquisition, stockpiling, or use of chemical weapons.
          <Date>Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania Bombed</Date>The morning news on
          August 7, 1998, greeted Americans with a shocking report: a truck bomb
          had demolished the U.S. embassy in downtown Nairobi, Kenya. More than
          200 people, twelve of them American citizens, had been killed. Minutes
          later, another truck bomb went off outside the American embassy in Dar
          es Salaam, Tanzania, killing eleven people. The combined attacks
          resulted in more than 5,000 injuries. Investigators, working closely
          with officials in both embassy nations, ultimately picked up six
          operatives (and indicted several others) connected with Al Qaeda(the
          base), a loosely knit Islamic fundamentalist, anti-American
          organization headed by the wealthy former Saudi, Osama bin Laden. In
          August 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa (Islamic decree) against the
          United States, demanding holy war and attacks on American troops. A
          year and a half later, bin Laden urged his followers to expand their
          sights to include all American throughout the world. President Bill
          Clinton declared the embassy bombings “abhorrent” and “inhuman” and
          pledged to “get answers and justice.” On August 20, the United States
          retaliated by firing cruise missile at suspected Al Qaeda training
          camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. President Clinton also blocked all
          financial transactions between bin Laden and U.S. banks, companies,
          and citizens. In May 2001, the investigation of the embassy bombings
          yielded four life sentences for men involved, while two others had
          already confessed to the crimes and had begun serving their sentences.
          In retrospect, it is clear that these attacks were precursors to the
          September 11 attacks in the United States. The embassy bombings
          confirmed to Americans the treachery of shadowy, able, and committed
          opponents who refused to distinguish between military and civilian
          personnel. They were yet another example of the frightening and
          uncertain dimensions of post-Cold War aggression.
          <Date>12/16/1998: Retaliatory attacks on Iraq</Date>President Clinton
          orders a three-day bombing attack against Iraq after Saddam Hussein
          refuses to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.
