          <Date>02/16/2001: Attacking Iraq</Date>United States airplanes attack
          Iraqi radar sites to enforce a “no-fly zone.” Bush calls the military
          action a “routine mission.”
          <Date>04/01/2001: Spy plane downed over South China Sea</Date>A U.S.
          spy plane flying over the South China Sea is clipped by a Chinese
          fighter jet, forcing the American plane to make an emergency landing
          on Chinese soil. The incident strains diplomatic ties between the two
          nations as the United States demands that China return both the plane
          and its crew to American authorities.
          <Date>04/25/2001: Bush backs Taiwan over China</Date>
          President Bush signals a change in relations with China by officially
          pledging military support for Taiwan in the event of an attack by
          China. This is the first time a presidential administration has
          publicly acknowledged a position that had previously been implicitly
          accepted.
          <Date>09/11/2001: September 11 Terrorist Attacks</Date>
          On September 11, 2001, the United States endured a deadly attack when
          terrorists hijacked four commercial planes and intentionally crashed
          them. The hijackers flew the first three planes into important
          targets: both towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and
          the Pentagon building in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane, which some
          speculated was headed for the White House, crashed in Somerset County,
          Pennsylvania. Passengers aboard the plane, talking on their cell
          phones, learned what the hijackers intended to do and with astonishing
          heroism tried to overtake the hijackers, saving the fourth target and
          sacrificing their lives. Police and fire department personnel in New
          York City rushed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center after
          the planes crashed into them to begin rescuing victims from the
          burning towers. Their colleagues assisting matters outside- like all
          Americans- were shocked and horrified to see those towers collapse,
          killing hundreds of the rescue workers and thousands of people who had
          been trapped inside. Total casualties from September 11, 2001, were
          nearly 3,000 people. President George W. Bush spoke passionately of
          “disbelief, terrible sadness and quiet, unyielding anger.” He pledged
          that the government would bring the persons responsible for the
          hijacking to justice. It soon became clear that Al Qaeda, a
          loosely-knit Sunni Islamic extremist organization, was responsible for
          the attacks. Al Qaeda's founder was former Saudi citizen and
          millionaire Osama bin Laden. After Afghanistan's ruling elite- the
          Taliban- refused to surrender bin Laden, who was a guest in their
          country, President Bush swiftly gathered international support for the
          use of military force in Afghanistan to shatter the strength of Al
          Qaeda. September 11, 2001, is a date that no American is likely ever
          to forget. Many Americans spent the day glued to their televisions, as
          terrible images of lives lost and property destroyed marched across
          the screens. Mingled with those pictures were others, equally
          memorable: scenes of magnificent courage, sacrifice, and hope. As a
          defining moment in modern United States history, September 11, 2001
          has justly been compared with December 7, 1941, the day the Japanese
          attacked Pearl Harbor. The words of President Franklin Roosevelt more
          than half a century ago are most appropriate: it is a date that surely
          will live in infamy.
          <Date>10/07/2001: Operation “Enduring Freedom”</Date>
          On October 7, 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the United
          States had begun military action in Afghanistan. The military
          operation was code-named Enduring Freedom. “On my order, U.S. forces
          have begun strikes on terrorist camps of Al Qaeda and the military
          installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan,” Bush said in a
          somber, televised address from the White House Treaty Room. The air
          assaults, he said, were joined by Britain, with assorted intelligence
          efforts and logistical support coming from several other nations,
          including France, Germany, Australia, and Canada. The United States
          had turned its attention to Afghanistan shortly after the September 11
          terrorist attacks because the Taliban regime had provided sanctuary to
          Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks. The
          United States demanded that the Taliban surrender Osama bin Laden, the
          leader of Al Qaeda. When the Taliban refused, the United States
          together with allies launched an attack against the Taliban.
          Apparently anticipating a U.S. attack, Al Qaeda had, a few days before
          the attacks, assassinated Ahmad Shah Massoud, the leader of an
          anti-Taliban rebel force known as the Northern Alliance. It was widely
          believed that without Massoud, the Northern Alliance would fracture as
          a fighting force. Instead, the Northern Alliance fought against the
          Taliban, bolstered by U.S. warplanes and U.S. Special Forces. First it
          ousted the Taliban from the city of Mazar Al-Sharif on the northern
          frontier and then from the capital city of Kabul. By mid-March 2002,
          the Taliban had been removed from power, and the Al Qaeda network in
          Afghanistan was severely damaged. A fledgling democracy was installed
          in Afghanistan, but even before that country was truly pacified, the
          Bush administration had turned its attention to Iraq and its dictator
          Saddam Hussein. With U.S. attention diverted, Afghanistan was left in
          a precarious state, threatened by instability, violence, and a
          possible Taliban resurgence.
          <Date>12/13/2001: Withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</Date>
          After conferring with the National Security Council, President Bush
          notifies Russia of his intention to withdraw from the 1972
          Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Meetings with Russian president
          Vladimir Putin fail to establish an agreement between the two nations.
          In June 2002, the United States officially withdraws from the Treaty,
          allowing it to conduct anti-missile defense tests.
          <Date>05/24/2002: Bush-Putin nuclear treaty</Date> At the Kremlin,
          President Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin sign a nuclear
          arms treaty, vowing to reduce their nations’ arsenals by two-thirds
          over the next ten years.
          <Date>09/04/2002: Action against Iraq</Date>Seeking support for action
          against Iraq, President Bush addresses Congress, identifying Iraqi
          strongman Saddam Hussein as “a serious threat.” Bush mentions the
          concept of a regime change and announces the visit of British Prime
          Minister Tony Blair in the days to come. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
          (R-TX) calls action in Iraq “inevitable.”
          <Date>02/12/2003: North Korea’s nuclear capabilities</Date>CIA
          director George Tenet announces that North Korea possesses a nuclear
          ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. In the
          following weeks, reports emerge which suggest that North Korea will
          soon possess the ability to create a nuclear arsenal.
          <Date>03/16/2003: Taking military action in Iraq</Date>After months of
          debate in the United Nations Security Council, President Bush
          announces the U.S. intention to move against Iraq with its coalition
          of allies. Bush issues an ultimatum for military action, giving Iraqi
          leader Saddam Hussein and his sons forty-eight hours to leave Iraq.
          <Date>05/22/2003: Iraq sanctions lifted</Date>The UN Security Council
          votes to lift sanctions on Iraq imposed since the 1991 Gulf War. The
          resolution gives the United States and United Kingdom control of Iraq
          until it establishes a legitimate government and authority to use
          Iraqi oil revenues for humanitarian aid and reconstruction.

            10/02/2003: Weapons Inspector finds no nuclear weapons in Iraq
          </Date>
          Chief U.S. Weapons Inspector David Kay reports that his 1,400 member
          team, the Iraq Survey Group, failed to find any biological, chemical,
          or nuclear weapons in Iraq. Kay acknowledged that they did find
          evidence that Iraq sought the capacity to create those weapons in the
          future. Bush used these findings as validation of his prewar claims
          that Iraq posed a significant security threat to the United States.
          <Date>01/08/2007: U.S. attacks al-Qaeda in Somalia</Date>The U.S. Air
          Force launches an air attack on extremist militias and suspected
          al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia.
          <Date>01/11/2007: Increasing troops in Iraq</Date>Bush announces what
          would be termed a “troop surge” in Iraq in an attempt to increase
          security in the capital of Baghdad and smother insurgency centers
          throughout the country.
