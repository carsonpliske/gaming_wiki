          “I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom
          of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power
          than by violent and sudden usurpations.”{" "}

          <Date>03/1809: Refurbish White House</Date>
          Congress authorizes $12,000 to refurbish the White House.
          <Date>04/19/1809: Erskine Agreement</Date> After negotiations with
          British minister Erskine, Madison issues a proclamation -- known as
          the Erskine Agreement -- revoking the embargo on Britain, effective
          June 10. For his part, Erskine leads Madison to believe that Britain
          will revoke its Orders in Council. On March 25, however, the American
          envoy in Britain learns that British foreign secretary Canning has
          canceled the Erskine Agreement; news reaches Madison six weeks later.
          On August 9, Madison rescinds his proclamation establishing trade with
          Britain and resumes a policy of nonintercourse.
          <Date>11/02/1810: Trade wars</Date>Under the terms of Macon's Bill
          Number 2, Madison accepts a French offer to stop confiscation of
          American supplies and ships. In February 1811, he declares a halt in
          trade with Britain unless the Orders are repealed. Undeterred, Britain
          vows to continue to seize American ships until France ends its trade
          restrictions.
          <Date>11/07/1811: Battle of Tippecanoe</Date>
          After acknowledging the danger posed by Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who
          hopes to assemble a confederation of tribes, General William Henry
          Harrison, the governor of the Indian Territory, carriers out a
          pre-emptive strike on Tecumseh. Harrison's militia is barely
          successful at the Battle of Tippecanoe, an engagement that serves as a
          prelude to the War of 1812. Tecumseh flees to Canada and British
          protection. On December 18, Madison proclaims the Battle of Tippecanoe
          a victory that will restore peace to the northwestern frontier.
          <Date>03/09/1812: Relations with Canada</Date>Madison shares the
          letters of John Henry, agent for governor of Canada, with Congress,
          having purchased the letters the previous month for $50,000. The
          documents indicate that the governor general of Canada is inciting
          rebellion in New England.
          <Date>06/18/1812: Declaration of war</Date>Madison issues a
          declaration of war against Britain. In addition to concern over
          British actions with regard to international trade, some proponents of
          war also endorse territorial expansion into British Canada and Spanish
          Florida; they also hope to end suspected British support of Indian
          attacks. Without the Bank of America and with an Army of only 6,700,
          the United States faces dire economic and military straits at the
          war's outset. The U.S. Navy, with a fleet of only sixteen vessels,
          delivers the nation's only victories in the first year of war.
          <Date>09/10/1813: Battle of Put-In-Bay</Date>In an impressive display
          of valor, Captain Oliver Perry wins control of Lake Erie in the Battle
          of Put-In-Bay. For four hours, Perry's flagship, the Lawrence,
          receives heavy attacks from two British warships, leaving most of his
          crew dead or wounded. Instead of surrendering, however, Perry rows to
          another ship and launches an attack on the British, finally accepting
          surrender of the entire British fleet. Perry sends word to General
          Harrison, stating, “We have met the enemy and they are ours.”
          <Date>10/05/1813: Battle of Thames</Date>The United States under
          General Harrison emerges victorious at the Battle of the Thames -- the
          most important American victory to date -- as it ends British and
          Indian control in Northwest and Upper Canada. Tecumseh dies in the
          <Date>03/27/1814: Battle of Horseshoe Bend</Date>Under the command of
          Andrew Jackson, 2,000 troops defeat the Creek Confederation at the
          Battle of Horseshoe Bend in the Tallapoosa River, eliminating the
          Confederation as an obstacle to American expansion toward the Gulf
          Coast. The engagement is one of the most significant American
          victories in the War of 1812, providing the United States with
          two-thirds of Creek land in the Treaty of Fort Jackson.
          <Date>British Troops Set Fire to White House</Date>On August 24, 1814,
          during the War of 1812, British troops invaded Washington, D.C., and
          set the White House, the Capitol, and other federal buildings on fire.
          The city had been evacuated before the British arrived with President
          James Madison and his administration leaving the capital city to flee
          the invading soldiers. During the war, British and American troops
          clashed up and down the East Coast, from Canada down to New Orleans.
          The war began after President Madison requested a declaration of war
          from Congress to protect American ships on the open seas and to try to
          stop the British practice of impressments, the seizure of U.S. sailors
          for service in Britain's Navy. The first years of the war proved
          disastrous for the United States. By the fall of 1812, the British had
          defeated American forces in Detroit and in western New York; in fact
          much of the Northwest Territory had fallen to the British. The
          Americans began to have military success in the spring of 1813 when
          the U.S. Navy defeated the British fleet on Lake Erie and U.S. forces
          sacked the Canadian capital in York. The United States also won
          significant battles against Native Americans in Ontario and the
          Mississippi Territory. Events swung back against the Americans in the
          late spring on 1814 as the British went on the offensive. British
          ships raided American ports from Georgia to Maine. After they landed
          in the Chesapeake Bay, British troops began to march towards
          Washington, D.C. They encountered little resistance along the way.
          James Monroe, who served as Madison's secretary of state and of
          defense, led a scouting party to report on the British advance. He
          sent word to President Madison that the British were marching toward
          Washington, D.C., and Madison and other government officials left the
          city for the countryside. First Lady Dolley Madison resisted the calls
          to evacuate. When she finally left, she made sure that a portrait of
          George Washington by Gilbert Stuart was removed from the White House
          and stored safely. She also took several important cabinet documents
          with her when she departed. As the British troops headed toward to
          capital, Monroe stayed to help with the city's evacuation. Once the
          British troops entered the city, they torched the White House and most
          other federal buildings in retaliation for the burning of the Canadian
          Parliament buildings in York. The United States was ultimately
          victorious in the War of 1812, and the Treaty of Ghent was signed by
          both countries in December 1814. Washington, D.C., was gradually
          rebuilt. It took three years to rebuild the White House, and in
          October 1817, President James Monroe moved back into the reconstructed
          White House.
          <Date>01/08/1815: Battle of New Orleans</Date>Jackson, leading 4,000
          militiamen, citizens, and regular soldiers, wins a resounding victory
          over 6,000 British forces in the Battle of New Orleans. Many of
          Jackson's troops are volunteers, among them free blacks and slaves.
          There are just a dozen American casualties to 2,000 British
          casualties. Jackson's victory, along with his success against the
          Creeks, makes him a national hero.
          <Date>05/10/1815: War on Algiers</Date>With Madison having secured a
          declaration of war on Algiers, Captain Stephen Decatur leads a
          flotilla from New York against the Mediterranean pirates, who attack
          American ships during the War of 1812. Algiers surrenders on June 30.
